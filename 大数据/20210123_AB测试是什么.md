In the online world, the number of visitors on your website equals the number of opportunities you have to expand your business by acquiring new customers and build relationships by catering to existing ones.

在线上世界，你的网站有多少访客等于你有多少机会能够通过吸引新客户，以及通过迎合现有客户建立关系的方式来进行业务扩展。

Businesses want visitors to take action (also called a conversion) on their website, and the rate at which a site can drive this is called its “conversion rate.” The more optimized your funnel, the higher is the conversion rate.
