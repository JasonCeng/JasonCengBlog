# 什么是data pipeline?

A data pipeline is a series of data processing steps. If the data is not currently loaded into the data platform, then it is ingested at the beginning of the pipeline. Then there are a series of steps in which each step delivers an output that is the input to the next step. This continues until the pipeline is complete. In some cases, independent steps may be run in parallel.

数据管道是一系列数据处理步骤。如果当前未将数据加载到数据平台中，则在管道的开始处将其提取。然后是一系列步骤，其中每个步骤都将输出作为下一步的输入。这一直持续到管道完成为止。在某些情况下，独立步骤可以并行运行。
